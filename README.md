### 👤 About Me

I am a final-year **Computer Systems Engineering** student with a focus on **software development, frontend and mobile applications**, and an academic background in **IoT projects**.

What defines me as a developer is my **hybrid profile**: I combine engineering with a background in **visual arts** and previous academic experience in **international environments**. This allows me to approach software not only from a technical perspective, but also from a user-centered, communicative and creative point of view.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> “I build software with both logic and intention — thinking about users, clarity and impact.”
